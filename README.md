# Questions:
  1. Do you eat on campus for lunch?  If so, where?
  2. How do you usually choose your campus dining location for lunch?
  3. Do you feel that long wait times hinder your ability to make it to get lunch between classes, especially Tuesday/Thursday (where the gap between classes is shorter)?  How do you usually overcome this hurdle?
  4. If you knew a dining location you do not usually frequent had a very short waiting time, would you be inclined to go there?  Why/why not?
  5. Would you be interested in a service that suggested where you should eat, based on waiting times on campus?
  6. Would you be willing to report to the program how long you waited for food on campus?
  7. Do you think that Vanderbilt students would be interested in a service such as this?  Why/why not?
  8. Do you trust that other people partaking in this service would accurately report their waiting time data?
  9. What information about dining locations during the lunch rush would you want to receive, if you could choose?
  10. What would be an acceptable margin of error for such a service? (ex, the texting service says wait will be 10 minutes and wait is actually 15 - is this acceptable? What is the acceptable error?)

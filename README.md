# Questions:
  1. Do you eat on campus for lunch?  If so, where?
  2. How do you usually choose your campus dining location for lunch?
  3. Do you feel that long wait times hinder your ability to make it to get lunch between classes, especially Tuesday/Thursday (where the gap between classes is shorter)?  How do you usually overcome this hurdle?
  4. If you knew a dining location you do not usually frequent had a very short waiting time, would you be inclined to go there?  Why/why not?
  5. Would you be interested in a service that suggested where you should eat, based on waiting times on campus?
  6. Would you be willing to report to the program how long you waited for food on campus?
  7. Do you think that Vanderbilt students would be interested in a service such as this?  Why/why not?
  8. Do you trust that other people partaking in this service would accurately report their waiting time data?
  9. What information about dining locations during the lunch rush would you want to receive, if you could choose?
  10. What would be an acceptable margin of error for such a service? (ex, the texting service says wait will be 10 minutes and wait is actually 15 - is this acceptable? What is the acceptable error?)


# Answers:
## Question 1:
1. Yes, either in rand at the saut√© spot, pub, or the library cafe
2. Library cafe always.
3. Yes, usually rand. Specifically the bowls or randwiches
## Question 2:
1. How much time I have to socialize
2. Based on wait time and on healthy option availability
3. I pick what I'm craving
## Question 3:
1. My lunch break is long enough that this is not an issue
2. Yes. I will try my best to get to the location as soon as possible after class is let out and often will eat on the way to class.
3. My shortest lunch break is two hours so I just try to eat at off hours so I don't need to wait in ridiculous lines
## Question 4:
1. Yes, but only if it were a busy day and the place had study spots nearby 
2. Yes. I would have more time to actually eat the food rather than slam it in as I walk to my next obligation.
3. Probably
## Question 5:
1. That would be fairly clutch 
2. Yes.
3. Yes.
## Question 6:
1. Possibly, depending on how easy it would be
2. Yes.
3. Yes.
## Question 7:
1. yes, but the idea might suffer from the tragedy of the commons
2. Yes, I think a lot of students try to just get something to eat between classes or their next obligation and knowing where this can be done with the least hassle is a service I think students would use. 
3. Yes because it would be helpful especially since the lines for things like bowls get really long
## Question 8:
1. honesty, not entirely
2. Yes.
3. Yes.
## Question 9:
1. waiting time would be ideal, potentially if there were items that were out of stock 
2. How crowded it is, availability of open seating, wait times.
3. I'd like to be able to pick which dining options I'd want to eat at and then receive the wait times for them. It also would be nice to be able to pick a wait time and receive a notification when the dining option of my choice has a wait time at or under my specified time.
## Question 10:
1. 10% error
2. I would say an error rate of anything greater than 10 minutes over would be unacceptable especially if I have increased my walking distance to find a location with a shorter wait time.
3. That's acceptable particularly during the beginning or end of lunch rush when the wait times are rapidly changing.

# Questions:
  1. Do you eat on campus for lunch?  If so, where?
  2. How do you usually choose your campus dining location for lunch?
  3. Do you feel that long wait times hinder your ability to make it to get lunch between classes, especially Tuesday/Thursday (where the gap between classes is shorter)?  How do you usually overcome this hurdle?
  4. If you knew a dining location you do not usually frequent had a very short waiting time, would you be inclined to go there?  Why/why not?
  5. Would you be interested in a service that suggested where you should eat, based on waiting times on campus?
  6. Would you be willing to report to the program how long you waited for food on campus?
  7. Do you think that Vanderbilt students would be interested in a service such as this?  Why/why not?
  8. Do you trust that other people partaking in this service would accurately report their waiting time data?
  9. What information about dining locations during the lunch rush would you want to receive, if you could choose?
  10. What would be an acceptable margin of error for such a service? (ex, the texting service says wait will be 10 minutes and wait is actually 15 - is this acceptable? What is the acceptable error?)

2. Yes. I will try my best to get to the location as soon as possible after class is let out and often will eat on the way to class.
## Question 4:
1. Yes, but only if it were a busy day and the place had study spots nearby 
2. Yes. I would have more time to actually eat the food rather than slam it in as I walk to my next obligation.

2. Yes.
## Question 6:
1. Possibly, depending on how easy it would be
2. Yes.
## Question 7:
1. yes, but the idea might suffer from the tragedy of the commons
2. Yes, I think a lot of students try to just get something to eat between classes or their next obligation and knowing where this can be done with the least hassle is a service I think students would use. 
## Question 8:
1. honesty, not entirely
2. Yes.
## Question 9:
1. waiting time would be ideal, potentially if there were items that were out of stock 
2. How crowded it is, availability of open seating, wait times.
## Question 10:
1. 10% error
2. I would say an error rate of anything greater than 10 minutes over would be unacceptable especially if I have increased my walking distance to find a location with a shorter wait time.
